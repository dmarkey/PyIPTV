#### "Failed to start recording"
- **Cause**: Stream URL not accessible or invalid
- **Solution**: Try playing the channel first to verify it works
- **Check**: Ensure you have write permissions to the output directory

#### "No stream URL available"
- **Cause**: Channel doesn't have a valid stream URL
- **Solution**: Check the M3U playlist for valid URLs
- **Note**: Some channels may be offline or have expired URLs

#### Recording stops unexpectedly
- **Cause**: Stream went offline or network issues
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and stream availability
- **Note**: This is normal for live streams that go offline

### üí° Tips and Best Practices

#### Storage Management
- **Monitor disk space**: Recordings can be large (1-2 GB per hour)
- **Regular cleanup**: Delete old recordings you no longer need
- **External storage**: Consider using external drives for long recordings

#### Quality vs. Size
- **Stream copy**: Best quality, larger files, no CPU usage
- **Re-encode**: Smaller files, lower quality, uses CPU
- **Recommendation**: Use stream copy for most cases

#### Multiple Recordings
- **Simultaneous**: Record multiple channels at once
- **Performance**: Each recording uses network bandwidth
- **Limit**: Depends on your internet speed and system resources

#### Scheduling (Future Feature)
- Currently: Manual start/stop only
